## Pylon NPC and Calamity Music Add-on

I created these mods during the COVID-19 pandemic to solve a couple of issues I had with the game. They were created using C# on visual studio, and them uploaded to the tModLoader mod browser. **These mods need to be updated to the latest tModLoader version, they are currently developed for 1.3.5**

**Pylon NPC**
Pylon NPC is a mod that adds an NPC that allows you to buy a potion to teleport to different biomes in your world. It also allows you to buy a teleporter and key to telelport to anywhere where the teleporters are placed, kind of like the pylon system in 1.4.

The NPC spawns after you defeat the Eye of Cthulhu.

You need AlchemistNPCLite for the potions and/or PreHMTeleportation for the teleporters.

**CMusicPlanet**

Calamity Music: Planetoids & Abyss Miniboss a mod that adds scrapped music for the planetoids and the Eidolon Wyrm.

A config is added to toggle these themes off and on

All the credit goes to DM Dokuro, the creator of these themes.
