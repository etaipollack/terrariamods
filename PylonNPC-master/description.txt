Pylon NPC is a mod that adds an NPC that allows you to buy a potion to teleport to different biomes in your world. It also allows you to buy a teleporter and key to telelport to anywhere where the teleporters are placed, kind of like the pylon system in 1.4.

The NPC spawns after you defeat the Eye of Cthulu.

You need AlchemistNPCLite for the potions and/or PreHMTeleportation for the teleporters.

All of the credit goes to the creators of PreHMTeleportation and AlchemistNPCLite
